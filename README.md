# modeling-languages
Facilitating the collaborative authorship of selected pages from the modeling-languages.com site.

Each .html file (only one currently) refers to a page in the modeling-languages.com site. Feel free to send your contributions to each page. Every week, the new version with the merged changes will be used to replace the online version.

Avoid formatting changes. Note the online version is a WordPress site and therefore arbitrary HTML changes may break the visuaalization of the page once in WordPress.
