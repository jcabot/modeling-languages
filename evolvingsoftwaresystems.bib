abstract = {A frequent characterization of open source software is the somewhat outdated, mythical one of a collective of supremely talented software hackers freely volunteering their services to produce uniformly high-quality software. I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss the shift in the application of the bazaar metaphor from the development process to the product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground-rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

year={2007},
pages={15-22},
abstract={During maintenance, professional developers generate and test many hypotheses about program behavior, but they also spend much of their time navigating among classes and methods. Little is known, however, about how professional developers navigate source code and the extent to which their hypotheses relate to their navigation. A lack of understanding of these issues is a barrier to tools aiming to reduce the large fraction of time developers spend navigating source code. In this paper, we report on a study that makes use of information foraging theory to investigate how professional developers navigate source code during maintenance. Our results showed that information foraging theory was a significant predictor of the developers' maintenance behavior, and suggest how tools used during maintenance can build upon this result, simply by adding word analysis to their reasoning systems.},

	Abstract = {Software vendors lack the perspective to develop software within a software ecosystem. The inability to function in a software ecosystem has already led to the demise of many software vendors, leading to loss of competition, intellectual property, and eventually jobs in the software industry. In this paper we present a research agenda on software ecosystems to study both the technical and the business aspects of software engineering in vibrant ecosystems. The results of such research enable software vendors to develop software that is adaptable to new business models and new markets, and to make strategic choices that help a software vendor to thrive in a software ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {Past software engineering literature has firmly established that software architectures and the associated code decay over time. Architectural decay is, potentially, a major issue in free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) projects, since developers sporadically joining FLOSS projects do not always have a clear understanding of the underlying architecture, and may break the overall conceptual structure by several small changes to the code base. This paper investigates whether the structure of a FLOSS system and its decay can also be influenced by the repository in which it is retained: specifically, two FLOSS repositories are studied to understand whether the complexity of the software structure in the sampled projects is comparable, or one repository hosts more complex systems than the other. It is also studied whether the effort to counteract this complexity is dependent on the repository, and the governance it gives to the hosted projects.The results of the paper are two-fold: on one side, it is shown that the repository hosting larger and more active projects presents more complex structures. On the other side, these larger and more complex systems benefit from more anti-regressive work to reduce this complexity.},

When dealing with the large amounts of information that are analyzed during reverse engineering visualization and exploratory navigation are important tools. However, a software system does not exist by itself. Instead, a project is part of a larger software ecosystem of projects that is developed in the context of an organization, a research group of an open-source community. In our work, we argue that reverse engineering an ecosystem is a natural and complementary extension to the traditional single system reverse engineering. We propose a methodology based on visualization, top-down exploration, architecture recovery and software evolution analysis for the reverse engineering software ecosystems. Our methodology starts with visualizing high-level structural and evolutionary aspects of the ecosystem from which the reverse engineer can navigate to views which present architectural aspects of the individual projects. To support our approach we implemented tool support for analyzing the ecosystem level as well as the intra-project level.},

	Abstract = { This paper explores the relationship between cumulative change and complexity in an evolving Open Source system. The study involves measurements at the function and file level. In order to measure cumulative change, the approach used a metric termed release-touches, which counts the number of releases for which a given file has been modified. Based on the value of this metric, we ranked the files and used the ranking in order to identify two groups, the more stable and the less stable parts of the source code. Complexity was measured using two derivatives of the McCabe index. Histograms and distributions were visually and statistically analyzed. The results empirically suggest that at the file level there are correlations between high cumulative change, large size and high complexity. This paper provides an approach for identifying with functions need to be refactored first if one wishes to reduce the complexity of the system.},

	Abstract = {Correcting software defects accounts for a significant amount of resources such as time, money and personnel. To be able to focus testing efforts where needed the most, researchers have studied statistical models to predict in which parts of a software future defects are likely to occur. By studying the mathematical relations between predictor variables used in these models, researchers can form an increased understanding of the important connections between development activities and software quality. Predictor variables used in past top-performing models are largely based on file-oriented measures, such as source code and churn metrics. However, source code is the end product of numerous interlaced and collaborative activities carried out by developers. Traces of such activities can be found in the repositories used to manage development efforts. In this paper, we investigate statistical models, to study the impact of social structures between developers and end-users on software quality. These models use predictor variables based on social information mined from the issue tracking and version control repositories of a large open-source software project. The results of our case study are promising and indicate that statistical models based on social information have a similar degree of explanatory power as traditional models. Furthermore, our findings suggest that social information does not substitute, but rather augments traditional product and process-based metrics used in defect prediction models.},

	Abstract = { In this paper, we conducted a comparative study of how social organization takes place in a wasp colony and OSS developer communities. Both these systems display similar global organization patterns, such as hierarchies and clear labor divisions. As our analysis shows, both systems also define interacting agent networks with similar common features that reflect limited information sharing among agents. As far as we know, this is the first research study analyzing the patterns and functional significance of these systems' weighted-interaction networks. By illuminating the extent to which self-organization is responsible for patterns such as hierarchical structure, we can gain insight into the origins of organization in OSS communities.},

	Abstract = {There are different sources of software complexity. A large set of complexity metrics can measure distinct program attributes to show different program size indicators. Nevertheless, the size of a program must be obtained from the overall program complexity based on the values of all program factors. Based on the concept that software complexity is a measurement of the resources expended through the software life cycle, and the fact that a program may be approached from three distinct perspectives, the complexity factors are classified into three complexity domains: syntactical, functional, and computational. Each domain represents the magnitudes of the factors in one of the three dimensions: length, time, and level or depth. Using these ideas, in this article we define ordinal measures of the complexity factors based on discrete mathematical structures of programs and the information content or entropy, transform the different domains of software complexity in linear metric spaces in order to represent a program by a set of vectors whose magnitudes and distances represent metrics of the program components, and define a ``unified complexity metric'' of the program size and the effort needed to produce it over the multilinear complexity space conformed by the three complexity spaces. These metrics may be used to define a statistical method that estimates the size of a program and the effort needed to produce it from the external system design, the productivity in software projects, and the quality and value of software products.},

	Abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

	practice. However, research is still needed to validate their contributions
	to software maintenance. This paper presents a method for examining
	software systems that have been actively maintained and used over
	the long term and are potential candidates for yielding lessons about
	design. The method relies on a criterion of stability and a definition
	of distance to flag design characteristics that have potentially
	contributed to long-term maintainability. It is demonstrated by application
	to an example of long-lived scientific software. The results from
	this demonstration show that the method can provide insight into
	the relative importance of individual elements of a set of design
	characteristics for the long-term evolution of software.},

The need to investigate a system, not only as individual components but as a whole, emerges. This can be done by examining the elementary constituents individually and then how these are connected. The myriad components of a system and their interactions are best characterized as networks and they are mainly represented as graphs where thousands of nodes are connected with thousands of vertices. In this article we demonstrate approaches, models and methods from the graph theory universe and we discuss ways in which they can be used to reveal hidden properties and features of a network. This network profiling combined with knowledge extraction will help us to better understand the biological significance of the system.}},

  abstract = {Computer systems are used in many critical applications where a failure can have serious consequences (loss of lives or property). Developing systematic ways to relate the software quality attributes of a system to the system's architecture provides a sound basis for making objective decisions about design trade-offs and enables engineers to make reasonably accurate predictions about a system's attributes that are free from bias and hidden assumptions. The ultimate goal is the ability to quantitatively evaluate and trade off multiple software quality attributes to arrive at a better overall system. The purpose of this report is to take a small step in the direction of developing a unifying approach for reasoning about multiple software quality attributes. In this report, we define software quality, introduce a generic taxonomy of attributes, discuss the connections between the attributes, and discuss future work leading to an attribute-based methodology for evaluating software architectures.

Two studies are presented that investigate questions of validity and intrusiveness regarding a query-based technique.

The results of the two studies indicate that the query technique is not intrusive on normal subject behavior during the trial and does not suffer from limitations of human memory, which provides an indication of empirical validity. The results of other validity studies regarding the technique are discussed along with recommendations for its use in measuring situation awareness in varied settings.}},

Although a number of context models have been presented in the literature, none of them supports all of these requirements to a sufficient extent at the same time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and integrated approach for context modeling in pervasive computing environments. It combines the advantages of existing approaches and addresses the need for supporting effective software development. The proposed context model follows an ontology-based approach and has three layers of abstraction, i.e. conceptual layer, exchange layer, and functional layer. This layered approach facilitates a model-driven development of context-aware applications. Throughout the paper we compare our solution with the related work in order to clearly demonstrate why we needed to develop a new context management framework and where we have adopted existing ideas.},

The space of monitorable entities is huge and each context-aware application has specific monitoring requirements which can change at runtime as a result of new opportunities or constraints due to context variations. The issues dealt with in this paper are 1) to guide context-aware application designers in the specification of the monitoring of distributed context sources, and 2) to allow the adaptation of context management capabilities by dynamically taking into account new context data collectors not foreseen during the development process. The solution we present, CA3M, follows the model-driven engineering approach for answering the previous questions: 1) designers specialised into context management specify context-awareness concerns into models that conform to a context-awareness meta-model, and 2) these context-awareness models are present at runtime and may be updated to cater with new application requirements. This paper presents the whole chain from the context-awareness model definition to the dynamic instantiation of context data collectors following modifications of context-awareness models at runtime.},

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and experiences of developing a context management system that incorporates these ideas. It is based on a consumer-provider broker model, where providers employ a common context representation format, decoupling various entities involved in the production and consumption of context information. We demonstrate how the idea of independent context providers can aid in end-to-end working of a context management framework. One of the major advantages compared to other approaches is the extendibility of the system. By progressively adding Context Providers to legacy mobile communication systems, new context domains can be added. The system is able to evolve constantly and support a variety of emerging context-aware services and applications.},

This change inevitably affects the software running on such devices by necessitating additional functionality such as context awareness and adaptive behavior. While some developers design their systems to be fully self-reliant with regard to context awareness, others aim for more synergistic approaches by allowing context sharing across devices. This paper describes our experience with first designing and implementing a basic context management system, and then with extending it to allow context distribution. In the proposed architecture, the developers define the context dependencies for their software independently of the availability of context information in their corresponding devices. An automated mechanism is then used to match these needs to the corresponding providers, even when those reside across distributed devices. This approach enables them to utilize shared context information at runtime thus reducing both development efforts and hardware costs.},

In this perspective, we introduce the Context Matching Engine that trades off the cost, the user preferences and the quality of the available context information in order to discover the best context sources for each customized context-aware service. According to the proposed approach, there is no need for the services to know beforehand the context providers to retrieve information, but the evaluation and the quality-aware selection of the context information on context request are envisioned. Finally, it allows services to be ported easily to environments with different set of context sources.},

Numerous attempts to build middleware or infrastructure for context-aware systems have been made, but these have provided only partial solutions; for instance, most have not adequately addressed issues such as mobility, fault tolerance or privacy. One of the goals of this paper is to provide an analysis of the requirements of a middleware for context-aware systems, drawing from both traditional distributed system goals and our experiences with developing context-aware applications. The paper also provides a critical review of several middleware solutions, followed by a comprehensive discussion of our own PACE middleware. Finally, it provides a comparison of our solution with the previous work, highlighting both the advantages of our middleware and important topics for future research.},

	abstract={Many context-aware services make the assumption that the context they use is completely accurate. However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. Although some of this ambiguity may be resolved using automatic techniques, we argue that correct handling of ambiguous context will often need to involve the user. We use the term mediation to refer to the dialogue that ensues between the user and the system. In this article, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments. We present design guidelines that arise from supporting mediation over space and time, issues not present in the graphical user interface domain where mediation has typically been used in the past. We illustrate the use of our architecture and evaluate it through an example context-aware application, a word predictor system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Mobile context-aware applications are required to sense and react to changing environment conditions. Such applications, usually, need to recognize, classify and predict context in order to act efficiently, beforehand, for the benefit of the user. In this paper, we propose a mobility prediction model, which deals with context representation and location prediction of moving users. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used for trajectory classification. Spatial and temporal on-line clustering is adopted. We rely on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) for location prediction. Location prediction is treated as a context classification problem. We introduce a novel classifier that applies a Hausdorff-like distance over the extracted trajectories handling location prediction. Since our approach is time-sensitive, the Hausdorff distance is considered more advantageous than a simple Euclidean norm. A learning method is presented and evaluated. We compare ART with Offline kMeans and Online kMeans algorithms. Our findings are very promising for the use of the proposed model in mobile context aware applications.},

Its support for data quality metrics, context histories and fact type classifications make it an ideal design tool for context-aware systems. However, CML currently lacks a suitable representation for exchanging context models and instances in distributed systems. A runtime representation can be used by context-aware applications and supporting infrastructure to exchange context information and models between distributed components, and it can be used as the storage representation when relational database facilities are not present. This paper shows the benefits of using CML for modelling context as compared to commonly used RDF/OWL-based context models, shows that translations of CML to RDF or OWL are lossy, discusses existing techniques for serialising ORM models, and presents an alternative XML-based representation for CML called XCML},

High-level context information, however, poses several challenges to context management systems, which can be traced back to the asynchronicity of context acquisition and use and the inherent dynamics and imperfection in that process. This paper presents a three layer model allowing for dealing with the problems of imperfection and aging in a controlled way. It conceives the problem of high-level user context management as an information management problem with specific requirements. The approach has been applied to a context-aware learning environment for corporate learning support.},

We derive requirements for handling and modelling of QoC by analyzing the context provisioning process and show that existing integrations of QoC into context models are not adequate.

They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.},

This paper surveys the most relevant approaches to modeling context for ubiquitous computing. It also evaluates how the existing works utilize contextual information, with respect to the query processing approaches used to access and manage that information. We also discuss typical problems, shortcomings, and challenges posed by context modeling at large, and highlight some proposals to address some of them.},

Existing context management system implicitly assumes that a context representing user's situation can be fallen into just one of the two states such as valid or invalid. We observed that, however, a context can have additional state and transfer from one state to another seamlessly according to the change of a user-related context Such as user's location. The behavior of corresponding applications can also be finely tuned so that we can provide more adaptive services. For demonstration, we use the ontology for modeling and enriching the life cycle of a context. It enables LIS to utilize high-level inference capability which derives the current situation of a user. We also enhance the functionality of existing context management middleware using the context life cycle management scheme in this paper.},

	abstract={Supporting the individual user in his working, learning, or information access is one of the main goals of user modeling. Personal or group user models make it possible to represent and use information about preferences, knowledge, abilities, emotional states, and many other characteristics of a user to adapt the user experience and support. Nowadays, the disappearing computer enables the user to access her information from a variety of personal and public displays and devices. To support a new generation of contextualized and personalized information and services, this paper addresses the problem of context management. Context management is a new approach to the design of context-aware systems in ubiquitous computing that combines personalization and contextualization. The presented framework for context management integrates user modeling and context modeling, which can benefit from each other and give rise to more valid models for personalized and contextualized information delivery. The paper will introduce a base framework and tools for designing context-aware applications and decompose the underlying framework into its foundational components. As two illustrative application cases, the paper discusses implementations of an intelligent advertisement board and an audio-augmented museum environment.},

The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up systems perspective and a top-down users perspective.

This paper introduces and defines the concepts of isotropic context space, context granule and context model entropy as the basic features to formally describe and evaluate the RAP context model autonomic characteristics. The paper also propose a methodology for enhancing the RPA context model with self-configuring and self-healing autonomic properties. The self-configuring property or context adaptation is obtained by detecting / configuring / integrating new context resources / actors into the context specific model. The context model self-healing properties are obtained by continuously monitoring the real context for detecting broken context policies and executing compensating actions.},

  abstract = {In this paper a method for Partial {RDF} Encryption {(PRE)} is
proposed in which sensitive data in an {RDF-graph} is encrypted for a set
of recipients while all non-sensitive data remain publicly readable. The
result is an {RDF-compliant} self-describing graph containing encrypted
data, encryption metadata, and plaintext data. For the representation
of encrypted data and encryption metadata, the {XML-Encryption} and
{XML-Signature} recommendations are used. The proposed method allows
for fine-grained encryption of arbitrary subjects, predicates, objects and
subgraphs of an {RDF-graph.} An {XML} vocabulary for specifying encryption
policies is introduced.},

ULS systems are particularly likely to require dynamic adaptation because of their decentralized control and the large number of independent stakeholders whose actions are integral to the system's behavior. Adaptation may take various forms, but the system structure will almost inevitably include one or more closed feedback loops. We argue that adaptability is a characteristic of a solution, not of a problem, and that the feedback loop governing control of adaptability should be explicit in design and analysis and either explicit or clearly traceable in implementation.},

For each of these attributes the authors show a metric definition consistent with the published definitions of the software characteristic being measured. The result is a tree structure of maintainability metrics which can be used for purposes of evaluating the relative maintainability of the software system. The authors define metrics for measuring the maintainability of a target software system and discuss how those metrics can be combined into a single index of maintainability},

	often occurs in an ad-hoc fashion. One approach to structure system
	evolution is the concept of software product lines where a core architecture
	supports a variety of application contexts. However, in practice,
	the high cost and high risks of redevelopment as well as the substantial
	investments made to develop the existing systems most often mandate
	significant leverage of the legacy assets. Yet, there is little guidance
	in the literature on how to transition legacy assets into a products
	line set-up. In this paper, we present RE-PLACE, an approach developed
	to support the transition of existing software assets towards a product
	line architecture while taking into account anticipated new system

	line is able to deal with the variants evolved over time in a cost-effective

	the software into so-called genericity layers. We argue that federated
	architectures are at the heart of product lines, and we provide compelling
	arguments as to why federated architectures are a sound weapon in
	today's corporate strategy: they enable smooth enterprise integration
	and rapid change. We support our arguments with a real-world case:
	we successfully migrated a large global transaction and settlement
	system with many site-specific variations to a product line with
	a federated architecture. Moreover, we measured the success rate
	of this architectural modification effort by showing that the annual
	direct cost savings are of the order of millions of dollars during
	the deployment of the product line. Copyright Â© 2003 John Wiley

	Two methods developed by the Software Engineering Institute fill

	and the Options Analysis for Reengineering (OAR) method. Both of
	these methods, which are described in this report, support different
	aspects of the Product Parts Pattern, which is applied to develop
	the core assets for a product line. The MAP method provides a suitability
	analysis of existing systems' software architectures as candidates
	for a product line architecture. After an architecture has been developed
	or chosen, the OAR method provides a disciplined approach for making
	decisions on rehabilitating legacy assets that may be incorporated
	into the product line asset base. This technical note describes both
	the MAP and OAR methods, the activities that each involves, and examples

  abstract = {Software product lines have proved to be a successful and efficient
	means for managing the development of software in industry. The significant
	benefits over traditional software architectures have the potential
	to convince software companies to adopt the product line approach
	for their existing products. In that case, the question arises how
	to best convert the existing products into a software product line.
	For several reasons, an evolutionary approach is desirable. But so
	far, there is little guidance on the evolutionary introduction of
	software product lines. In this paper, we propose a lightweight iterative
	process supporting the incremental introduction of product line concepts
	for existing software products. Starting with the analysis of the
	legacy code, we assess what parts of the software can be restructured
	for product line needs at reasonable costs. For the analysis of the
	products, we use feature analysis, a reengineering technique tailored
	to the specific needs of the initiation of software product lines.},
